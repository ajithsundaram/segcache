Researching Segcache features
It minimizes per-object metadata by using shared segment headers and hash table slots, boosting scalability.
From the summary, Segcache uses a TTL-indexed bucket array with 1024 buckets, divided into four groups for efficient expiration.
It employs a bulk-chaining hash table to reduce random memory accesses, improving throughput for lookups.
I'm thinking about how to translate these features into Kotlin, starting with the hash table.
Let's outline the main components needed, like hash table, object store, and TTL buckets, to build this server.
Planning Kotlin implementation
Each segment is a fixed-size log, say 1 MB, storing objects sequentially, which I'll need to implement in Kotlin.
The hash table uses bulk-chaining with 8 slots per bucket, so I'll define a data class for HashBucket and HashSlot.
I'm considering using Kotlin's coroutines for concurrency, but might need locks for performance-critical parts.
Objects in segments share TTL and creation time, so the segment header will hold these, saving memory.
The hash table likely stores keys, with slots pointing to values in segments, which helps with get operations.
I'm figuring out how to handle network requests, assuming basic get, set, and delete with TTL support.
In Segcache, the tag in hash slots is probably a checksum for key validation, so I'll need to compute it during lookups.
Each object in the segment likely stores just the value, not the key, to save space, which fits the memory-efficient design.
The key isn't stored with the value to save memory; instead, the hash table uses the key for hashing and tag verification.
When retrieving, it checks the tag to ensure the correct value is returned, handling potential collisions with a good hash function.
The tag helps distinguish keys hashing to the same bucket, so I'll need to compute it from the key for lookups.
For implementation, I'll use data classes in Kotlin for clarity, though performance might need primitive types later.
For locks, I'm thinking about using java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock or AtomicBoolean for spin locks in Kotlin.
Usage counters and timestamps will be atomic, so I'll use AtomicInteger and AtomicLong for thread safety.
Designing data structures
When inserting, map the TTL to a bucket and find a segment with space, creating a new one if needed.
Objects in segments probably store just the value, with keys handled by the hash table for memory efficiency.
Each segment is linked to a TTL bucket, so all objects there have similar TTLs, which helps with expiration.
I'm planning to store objects in segments with size prefixes, like 4 bytes for size then the value, for easy reading.
TTL buckets are divided into four groups with increasing time widths, so I'll implement an array of 1024 lists for segments.
Each segment can be a class with a ByteArray, current offset, and creation time, making it easy to manage in Kotlin.
For expiration, a background thread will scan TTL buckets, removing expired segments to free memory efficiently.
Merge-based eviction will keep high-value objects, but I'll start with basic structure and add this later for complexity.
Mapping TTL to a bucket index seems key, so I'll need a function that takes TTL and returns the bucket, possibly using the summary's 1024 buckets divided into four groups with growing time-widths.
Concurrency is crucial, so I'm leaning towards ReentrantLock for buckets, though spin locks with AtomicBoolean could work for high performance.
Implementing segment storage
Segments are 1 MB ByteArrays, with a write position tracking free space. It'll help manage object storage efficiently.
Writing involves checking space, then storing size and value sequentially. This keeps data compact and easy to read.
In Kotlin, ByteArray lacks direct int write methods, so I'll implement custom functions for that. It ensures proper data handling.
I'm drafting some Kotlin code to handle segment storage, starting with a Segment class. Here's what it might look like:
Each bucket has 8 slots, with 7 for data, so if full, insertion might fail. I'm wondering how Segcache handles this scenario.
Probably, like hash tables, it could chain to another bucket if full. This could affect performance, so I'll explore options.
I'm thinking about using open addressing or secondary hashing, but that might complicate the design. Let's see what fits best.
If a bucket's full, Segcache likely triggers global eviction by merging segments. This keeps memory use in check and aligns with its design.
For now, I'll assume fixed slots per bucket, and if full, the cache evicts to make space. It'll simplify the initial implementation.
Let's create the Segment class in Kotlin to handle storage. Here's the code:
Browsing usenix.org for "implementation details or pseudocode of Segcache"
No implementation details or pseudocode in that page, just the abstract and metadata.
I'm considering looking for the full paper. From the search results, there's a link to the PDF: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-yang.pdf
The function result gives detailed pseudocode for Segcache's hash table, segment management, expiration, and eviction. It covers data structures and algorithms, which is perfect for the Kotlin implementation.
Each hash bucket has an 8-bit spin lock, usage counter, timestamp, and up to 7 object slots with segment ID, offset, frequency, and tag. This helps with efficient lookups and updates.
I'm translating these into Kotlin, starting with HashSlot. Frequency is 8-bit, but AtomicInteger in Kotlin is 32-bit, which is fine for now.
The HashBucket needs an 8-bit spin lock, so I'll use AtomicBoolean. It also has 7 object slots and one overflow, which I'll model as another HashSlot.
For the overflow, it can point to another bucket, so I'll make it nullable to handle chaining. This keeps the design flexible.
Defining HashBucket structure
The HashBucket class will have a spin lock using AtomicBoolean for simplicity. It'll ensure thread-safe access.
I'm setting up 7 slots for objects and one for overflow, following the pseudocode. This matches Segcache's bulk-chaining approach.
Usage counter and timestamp will be atomic, using AtomicInteger. It'll help track bucket state safely.
Each slot stores segment ID, offset, frequency, and tag, which I'll define in HashSlot. This aligns with the memory-efficient design.
Overflow can chain to another bucket if needed, so I'll make it a nullable HashBucket reference. It'll handle collisions effectively.
